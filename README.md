# Brendon's Random POCs

This is a collection of random experiments. These will most likely be created at a point in time to solve a specific problem, and then pretty much ignored after that. I'm putting them here so I can find them later if I need them and to easily share them with others. Use caution if you stumble across this repo, as these are not intended to be production ready code, and versions/features of the underlying tools may change.
